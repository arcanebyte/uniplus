Changes made after release 1.5:
priam.c:	added UNISOFT define which allows access to the boot blocks
		of the disk - when it is not defined the results are the same
		as for release 1.5 - it is not defined now

conf.c:		changed the tt_addr field of co_ttptr[0] to 1 from 0 - otherwise
		pstat thinks there is no co_ttptr[0]

config.c:	changed oemmsg
