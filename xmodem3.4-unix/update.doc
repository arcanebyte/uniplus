Changes leading to version 3.3

1) "Better" handshaking for MODEM7 batch transfers (5/19/87).

2) If reception of a file is aborted due to errors, delete incomplete file
(5/19/87).

3) If an "impossible" tty speed is detected, assume 1200 bps (5/19/87).

4) Disallow CAN-CAN abort during file send or receive except at beginning of
file transfer (during batch transfers, CAN-CAN abort is allowed at beginning
of each file transfer) (5/19/87).

5) Uncouple total allowed errors during the reception of a single packet 
(ERRORMAX, now made 10) and errors allowed when starting transfer (STERRORMAX, 
set to 10) (5/19/87).

6) Fix some bugs when receiving an empty file and when a phase error occurs
during a file reception (5/19/87).

7) Portability fix in prtime and projtime; they also handle pathological
cases better (5/19/87).

8) During file reception an EOT is not believed unless it is sent again in
response to a NAK (5/25/87).

9) Modified cpm_unix and unixify so a filename without an extension will not
have a trailing dot in its filename after being received in a MODEM7 or
YMODEM batch transfer (5/25/87).

10) Allowable errors during transmission of a single packet now set to
ERRORMAX (5/27/87).

11) When transferring a binary file, the YMODEM file length field is filled
in on transmit and (if present) used to truncate the file on reception.
A new truncate function (truncfile) added to getput.c to do the deed (5/28/87).
The file mode field is also set but is ignored on file reception.

12) In a batch receive (xmodem -rt), program can be forced into checksum mode
by specifying the "M" flag indicating a MODEM7 transfer (5/30/87).

13) Changed the "B" option to "M" to indicate MODEM7 batch.  Made all option
flags case insensitive.  Command line is now recorded in the log file
(5/30/87).

14) The "KND/IMP" convention of using "CK" to invoke 1K packets during YMODEM
batch transfers was installed.  This code will be sent during a batch recieve 
if "K" is included on the command line unless "M" is also present.  This code
will be recognized when sending under all circumstances (5/30/87).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes leading to version 3.4

1) Fix usage message (10/2/87).

2) Sender will now try up to 10 times (EOTMAX) to send an EOT to terminate a
transmission.  Used to be 5 times, but Chuck Forsberg's "official" minimum
requirements for YMODEM mandate 10 (10/2/87).

3) Handle YMODEM file modification times if present in header on reception of
both binary and text files (10/2/87).  Retracted when can't seem to get
proper times whn playing with dsz (10/3/87).  Found bug and reinstalled
feature (10/16/87).  Found REAL bug (10/21/87).

4) Null bytes are now stripped out of files when received as text files (MEX
doesn't seem to want to put in the terminating control-Z) (10/3/87).

5) Slightly modified terminal parameter setting to explicitly turn of CRMOD
and to flush read queue; ideas stolen from Kermit.  Will it fly on Pyramid?
(10/3/87).

6) Decreased time between "startup" characters sent when starting a file
receive operation.  This should increase perceived response.  Now waits 
WAITFIRST seconds (set to 1) instead of 6 (waits for 5 seconds for 
subsequent packets.  STERRORMAX now 60, CRCSWMAX now 30.  
Timeouts on 1st sector no longer reported in log (10/5/87).

7) Once again played with kernel sleeps in readbuf() (packet reading
routine).  On busy system could cause real problems.  Now supply flag (t) to
suppress sleeping on Too Busy systems.  No longer suppress sleep when speeds are
over 4800 bps.  Sleep kludge DOES help: on an empty 750 running 4.3BSD, a
file reception at 2400 bps used 6% of the CPU with the sleep kludge and 24%
without it (data transfer rates were the the same) (10/5/87).

8) Actually count characters as they are being read for a file reception.
When YMODEM file length is set, stop writing characters when reach length.
This will allow YMODEM file lengths to work for text files and the
elimination of truncfile() in getput.c (which was impossible for SYS V)
(10/5/87).

9) Another attempt at tty modes.  Now do nothing but set speeds, set mode to
raw, and turn off echoing and tandem (10/6/87).
