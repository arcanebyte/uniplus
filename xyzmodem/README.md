> This edition of the Unix rz/sz programs adds directory creation
> to rz and fixes a problem with running sz on BSD systems.  The
> doco has been enhanced to answer most of the questions people
> have had about these programs.

> This is being released on alt.sources and pnw.general to get some
> feedback before shipping off to the comp.sources.unix black hole.
