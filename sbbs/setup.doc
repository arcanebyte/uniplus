Introduction

SBBS runs as a login shell and takes a bit of work to install properly.
This document will help you do so and explain a few things about the way
SBBS operates.

Included with the SBBS package are four documentation files. They are:

.in +5
.nf
README    - an explanatory note
setup.doc - how to set up and configure an SBBS system
admin.doc - SBBS administration functions
config.tbl- valid configuration variables
.in -5
.fi

Installing SBBS

The most efficient way to run SBBS is to create a seperate login account for
the SBBS program. As SBBS maintains its own list of BBS users (and their
passwords), this allows users to simply type "su sbbs" to enter the program.
Alternately, if your version of UNIX ignores the default login shell when a
"su" command is executed, users can use "exec login sbbs". With a bit of
imagination and a knowledge of shell programming techniques, any number of
alternate methods can be devised.

All SBBS programs and files reside in one directory. The software is normally
configured to be based in the directory /u/sbbs, although this can be changed
to suit your particular needs. If you wish to place SBBS elsewhere, edit the
file login-sig and change the line

.in +5
dir=/u/sbbs
.in -5

reflect the desired location.

After you have decided on SBBS's home, make sure that directory is created and
then create a subdirectory called programs. All files from the shell
archives should be kept in this directory, usually called /u/sbbs/programs.

From this point on, the directory you have chosen for SBBS to reside in will
be referred to as ~sbbs.

After insuring that a copy of every file from the shell archives exists in
~sbbs/programs, run the "install" program. This will automatically create the
necessary SBBS data files.

Finally, add an appropriate line to your /etc/passwd file to allow users to
access SBBS. A typical example follows.

.in +5
sbbs::1000:1000:SBBS user:/u/sbbs:/u/sbbs/programs/initial
.in -5
