The contents of RZSZ.ARC are designed to be uploaded to a Unix or Xenix
system by ZCOMM or Professional-YAM using the supplied zupl.t script.
Connect to your Unix/Xenix system, select an empty directory, and then
give the YAM/ZCOMM command: "source zupl.t".  This will upload minirb.c,
compile it, and then use minirb to upload the rz/sz files.

Once these files are on your Unix system, you can type "make".
The Makefile will list the various systems it knows how to
compile the programs for, and the command to do so (e.g., "make bsd").

The Makefile is self explanatory; just say "make".

Naturally, rz and sz work best with comm programs that seamlessly
support ZMODEM command and file AutoDownload (Pro-YAM and ZCOMM).

The "DSZ" shareware program allows ZMODEM file transfers with
traditional DOS comm programs, but it must be called manually.
(The computer should do that for you!)  DSZ provides a "mini term
function" that supports ZMODEM AutoDownload.  DSZ (part of DSZ.ARC) and
the ZMODEM protocol description (YZMODEM.ARC) are on TeleGodzilla and
other fine bulletin boards.
