This is version 3.4 (finished 10/87) of the xmodem program, a full-featured
XMODEM implementation for 4.2/4/3BSD.  Since the previous release (version
3.2, see volume 7 of the archives), substantial improvements have been
made. See the file update.doc for details.  Also, some attempt has been
made to support SysV Unix systems; see below.

As far as I am concerned, this program has reached the end of its evolution.
Newer protocols (such as ZMODEM) will not be incorporated into xmodem.  Check
out Chuck Forsberg's rz/sz programs if you are interested in ZMODEM.

To answer one oft-asked question: No, I don't know how to tie the
full-featured xmodem program into tip or cu for file transfers when calling
out from a 4.2/4.3BSD system.  4.3BSD tip does have some undocumented hooks
for tying into other programs through redirecting file descriptors, but my
minimal attempts to utilize these hooks have failed.  However, several
years back, I built a VERY early version of xmodem (lacking XMODEM/CRC,
XMODEM-1K, MODEM7 batch or YMODEM) directly into 4.2BSD tip.  The changes
worked unmodified in 4.3BSD; the diff files are contained in the file
tip.diffs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The xmodem program implements the Christensen (XMODEM) file transfer
protocol for moving files between 4.2/4.3BSD Unix systems and microcomputers.
The XMODEM/CRC protocol, the MODEM7 batch protocol, the XMODEM-1K
block protocol and the YMODEM batch protocol are all supported by xmodem.
For details of the protocols, see the document edited by Chuck Forsberg titled
XMODEM/YMODEM Protocol Reference (the latest version is dated 8-4-87).

This program runs on 4.2/4.3BSD systems ONLY.  It has been tested on VAXes
and Suns against the MEX-PC program from Niteowl Software and the ZCOMM and
DSZ programs from Omen Technology.

I have tried to keep the 4.2isms (select system call, 4.2BSD/v7 tty structures,
gettimeofday system call, etc.) confined to the source file getput.c; but I 
make no guarantees.  Also, I have made no attempt to keep variable names 
under 7 characters.  A version of getput.c that MAY work on Sys V Unix
systems is included.

Thanks to Emmet Gray (ihnp4!uiucuxc!fthood!egray) and John Rupley 
(arizona!rupley!root) for the following notes about converting xmodem to Sys V.
Since I don't have a Sys V system to test a Sys V version, I won't even try.

1) Change the includes in xmodem.h from <sys/time.h> to <time.h>
   and from <sgtty.h> to <termio.h>

2) Convert the occurrences of rindex to strrchr in batch.c

3) Substitute getput.sysv.c for getput.c
