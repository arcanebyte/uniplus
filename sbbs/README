    The following files are programs that SBBS use or documentations. Move
all the programs to a specific place and move the documentations were best
put. Read setup.doc before installing SBBS.

    This archive(s) contain four documentations (including this one),
    two C programs - initial.c and lock.c(*).
    ~28 shell script files writen in Bourne Shell.

----
* initial.c is a fake "shell" that is called up when a person logs in as a
SBBS user or su's to it. It contains a simple function; execl(). This runs
a shell script login-sig as the LOWEST level shell. If your system doesn't
suport execl(), look for a simular function.

lock.c shouldn't give you much trouble. It works on a system III and can
be easily modified to work on any system.

Do neccessary changes to these files BEFORE you run "install".
